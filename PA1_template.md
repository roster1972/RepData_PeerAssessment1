## Loading and preprocessing the data
First, let's load the data and take a look . . .

```r
data <- read.csv('activity.csv')
names(data)
```

```
## [1] "steps"    "date"     "interval"
```

```r
head(data)
```

```
##   steps       date interval
## 1    NA 2012-10-01        0
## 2    NA 2012-10-01        5
## 3    NA 2012-10-01       10
## 4    NA 2012-10-01       15
## 5    NA 2012-10-01       20
## 6    NA 2012-10-01       25
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
